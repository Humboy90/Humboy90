## About Me

<br/>
Hey! I'm Mytheral, a university student game developer. I started my coding experience in middle school with Python and learned Python for 2 years. After my introduction with Python, I joined a project with several other students and self taught myself Unity C#, leading to the creation of Busytank.io. After the conclusion of that project, I continued to work more with Unity in solo development with my two projects lolOS and Space Mash.
